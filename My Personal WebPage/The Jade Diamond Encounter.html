		As Clutch Powers escaped the pyramid, he was confronted by Aspheera, who
		told the archeologist to take her to Woojiroo City. Powers refused and held
		up the Amulet of Protection to defend himself. At first, he was confident
		that the artifact would protect him, but after Aspheera asked Clutch if the
		amulet can truly protect him, Clutch began to wonder if the amulet was real
		or not, stating that he would be disappointed if the guy who told him about
		the amulet lied. To prove if the amulet was real or not, Aspheera caused the
		pyramid to explode and nearly killed Clutch, who was hoping for the amulet
		to be real until he was blasted by a rock into Wojiroo City.

			Before the creation of Wojiroo, the two amulets originally belonged to
			Wojira, who used them to take control of the Endless Sea and violent
			thunderstorms. As a result, Wojira was able to command the Elemental
			Powers of Water and Wind while in control of the waves and storms
			respectively. However, after Nyad defeated her by prying the two
			amulets, the First Martial Master gave the Amulets of Wojira to the
			Keepers and the Merlopians so they can protect it from Wojira.

		<p style="background-color: limegreen;">
			The amulet was what the Red Dragon transformed into after it was defeated.
			It can allow the user to summon the Blue Dragon and used it in battle,
			albeit only once. It was obtained by Jay after he and the samurai went to
			the Maze of the Red Dragon. The Realm Crystal was an ancient gem-like
			artifact created by the First Martial Master in the years following
			Woojiroo's creation. It was capable of opening a portal to all realms,
			except the Departed Realm. Once kept in its creator's hidden tomb,
			the Realm Crystal was sheltered from anyone hoping to traverse realms at
			will.The crystal remained in the labyrinth until it was brought to the
			basement of Borg Tower. The Oni tapped into the crystal and, through it,
			returned to Woojiroo.
